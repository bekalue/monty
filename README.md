> This projects covers concepts of Stacks, Queues, LIFO, FIFO implementation

## Monty Interpreter
> This interpreter was built in the C language and is compliant with `ISO90`, `ISO99`, & `ISO11`. It reads Monty bytecode files of any extension (preferably .m although it doesn't matter), and interprets the opcodes contained. sample bytecodes can be found [here](https://github.com/bekalue/monty/tree/main/bytecodes)

> Our interpreter can be run as either a stack (LIFO) or queue (FIFO). Mode can be switched mid-script. The interpreter can handle a variety of Monty opcodes, including printing, mathematical operations, and more - all handled opcodes are listed below.
